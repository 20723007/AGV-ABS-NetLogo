Model 1: AGV Power Monitoring and Control. The overall aims of the first scenario are to explore basic modeling procedure via Netlogo, to create a working model addressing the dynamic behaviors of AGV under the context of battery management while moving freely between stations, and to try out different approaches to monitor how AGV power usage differs in order to decide the most appropriate approach to manage power for AGV.
Model 2: AGV Dynamic Routing and Task Queuing. Scenario 2 simulates the operations of 2 AGVs, involving tasks handling and queuing, while traversing across pre-defined paths. Unlike the previous scenario, the routing mechanism of scenario 2 requires strict adherence to a set of preconfigured network of paths with the use of various waypoints in the network. Moreover, instead of dispersing materials indefinitely, the materials to be process in scenario 2 are limited based on the number of tasks to be performed by both AGVs.
